### Intended use

The contributions of all members are administrated by us and will be completely reinvested. The administrators are working completely voluntarily and do not get any money for doing their job.

The network has to be maintained, we need spare parts for the servers and other network hardware so that we can make sure every service is working. If you are having any further questions, just feel free to come by.

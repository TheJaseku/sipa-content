How to write a page or news

Create TWO new files in the folder which is associated with the menu under which your post should appear, usually named like this: pagename.de.md and pagename.en.md (e.g.: membership.de.md and membership.en.md).

For 'News' please use the naming scheme YEAR-MONTH-DAY-GERMANKEYWORD.de.md and YEAR-MONTH-DAY-ENGLISHKEYWORD.en.md. (E.g. 2015-03-09-new_website.de.md and 2015-03-09-new_website.en.md, according to ISO-8601.)
The KEYWORD is going to be the link to this file.(E.g. membership.de.md in /connect ->/connect/membership.) 

You can specify meta-information like this:
key: value

The following keys should exist:
title: Title of page in the appropriate language
author: The editor/writer of the content, if of interest.
date: Given in ISO-8601 again, e.g.: 2015-12-31

When writing a 'News', please include furthermore:
time: time in 24h format (eg. 17:34)
type: choose between alert, warning, info, good or default. 'default' will not display anything special.

When creating other pages (which are not in News), you should also include:
direct: true if the page should show up in the navbar, otherwise false
glyphicon: a glyphicon to use in the menu bar, choose from http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons (eg. glyphicon-log-in).


If you only want to create a direct link to a third-party-site:
title: title of the link
link: absolute link 
glyphicon: as above

You will have to leave one line free between meta-information and your markdown-content.
